      Hoptons of Epworth Limited T/A Save On Used Cars is authorised and
      regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, FRN: 655099. All finance is
      subject to status and income. Written quotation on request. We act as a
      credit broker not a lender. We work with a number of carefully selected
      credit providers who may be able to offer you finance for your purchase.
      We are only able to offer finance products from these providers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can introduce you to a limited number of finance providers. We do not
      charge fees for our Consumer Credit services. We may receive a payment(s)
      or other benefits from finance providers should you decide to enter into
      an agreement with them, typically either a fixed fee or a fixed percentage
      of the amount you borrow. The payment we receive may vary between finance
      providers and product types. The payment received does not impact the
      finance rate offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Please note</strong> - Retail customers using a finance broker
      outside our official panel of lenders, due to the fees incurred through
      these providers, a £225 admin fee is applied to these deals.
